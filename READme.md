## Where to find everything

- All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.
We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.
There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
